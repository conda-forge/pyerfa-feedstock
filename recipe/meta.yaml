  summary: Python bindings for ERFA routines
  description: |
    PyERFA is the Python wrapper for the ERFA library (Essential Routines for
    Fundamental Astronomy), a C library containing key algorithms for astronomy,
    which is based on the SOFA library published by the International
    Astronomical Union (IAU). All C routines are wrapped as Numpy universal
    functions, so that they can be called with scalar or array inputs.

    The project is a split of astropy._erfa module, developed in the context of
    Astropy project, into a standalone package. It contains the ERFA C source
    code as a git submodule. The wrapping is done with help of the Jinja2
    template engine.
